# Description of reverse WHOIS lookup
<p>
Reverse WHOIS lookup is a tool to search for domains by the name, address, telephone number, email address or physical address of the Registrant listed in current or historical WHOIS records. Reverse Whois searches are a key tool in cybercrime investigations such as fraud detection, intrusion detection, piracy schemes, etc. because they allow investigators to find all domains offenders and their associates use. Brand owners may use reverse Whois lookups for uncovering trademark infringements such as cybersquatting. Knowing the rest of the infringer's domains prevents future violations as well. Sometimes domains have private Whois so owner details are not available.
